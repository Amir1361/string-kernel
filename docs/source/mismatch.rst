Mismatch Kernel
===============

Mismatch kernel is used with support vector machines (SVMs) in a discriminative approach to classification problem. The mismatch kernel measures sequence similarity based on shared occurrences of **k**-length subsequences, counted with up to **m** mismatches, that is, what we generally state as **(k, m)-mismatch**, and do not rely on any generative model for the positive training sequences. The kernels can be efficiently computed by using a mismatch tree data structure [1]_. Plus, the mismatch kernel used with an SVM classifier performs fairly well, which has been proved in the provided tutorial 'mismatch_tutorial.ipynb'.

The key elements needed to be defined by users are described as following:

- data: 2D matrix of shape (n_samples, n_features), sequences needed to be computed as kernel

- l: int, size of alphabet. Examples of values with a natural interpretation:
     
     2: for binary data
     
     256: for data encoded as strings of bytes
     
     4: for DNA/RNA sequence data (bioinformatics)
     
     20: for protein data (bioinformatics)
     
- k: int, used in k-mers to compute the kernel
     
- m: int, maximum number of mismatches for 2 k-mers to be considered 'similar'. Normally, small values of m should work well. Plus, the complexity the algorithm is exponential in m

Finally, the expected result is the mismatch string kernel:
     
- kernel: 2D matrix of shape (n_samples, n_samples) suggesting the similarities between sequences


How to use the Mismatch Kernel
------------------------------

The collection of computed sequences has to be defined as a list of strings, for example::

    mismatch_collection = ['aATGCg', 'ACGTTT', 'agATGC','TCACcg', 'cgTCTCGAgt']

This collection can then be used to compute the mismatch kernel::

    from strkernel.mismatch_kernel import MismatchKernel
    motif_kernel = MismatchKernel(l=l, k=k, m=m).get_kernel(mismatch_collection)

Particularlly, the sequence collection is recommended to be preprocessed to regulate the input format and avoid subsequent errors before being applied to compute the mismatch kernel, which can be achieved by calling the function *preprocess* in *mismatch_kernel*::

    from strkernel.mismatch_kernel import preprocess
    after_process = preprocess(mismatch_collection)
    mismatch_kernel = MismatchKernel(l=l, k=k, m=m).get_kernel(after_process)

Afterwards, the derived kernel, a sparse matrix indicating the similarities between different sequences based on inner product of occurence counts of all (k, m)-mismatch kmers. If the lower case letters in every string are being considered, the parameter *ignoreLower* in *preprocess* function should be set as **False**, which is **True** by default. In addition, the function *get_kernel* can also be tuned by setting parameter *normalize*. Normalization is enabled by default since it generally improves accuracy. Normalization is realized by doing: **kernel[x, y] / sqrt(kernel[x, x] * kernel[y, y])**. That is, the diagonal elements in kernel matrix are set as 1 regarding that the similarity between a certain string and itself should be 'biggest'::

    sequences = ['aatgcACGTTGAgatcg','acgtgACGTTTGacggt', 'agtccATGCTGTaagtc','gttccTCACCGTcgcgt', 'gtacgTCTCGCTgtcgt']
    # preprocess
    after_process = preprocess(mismatch_collection, ignoreLower=False)
    # compute mismatch kernel
    mismatch_kernel = MismatchKernel(l=l, k=k, m=m).get_kernel(after_process, normalize = False)

Last but not least, the mismatch kernel also includes an attribution to display the middle step of getting a kernel providing an opportunity for users to check the details to compute the final kernel. 'leaf_kmers' shows us all mismatch kmers and the occurence counts of every k-mer in every string. n vectors of length m can derive from 'leaf_kmers', where n is number of strings, whose similarities will be computed in the susequent steps and m is the number of all k-mers. The similarity between string i and string j is the inner product of vector i and j, where 1<= i, j <= n::

    print(mismatch_kernel.leaf_kmers)
